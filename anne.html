   <p class="des"><b>anne frank <br> <br>The diary as Anne Frank wrote it. At last, in a  new translation, 
    this definitive edition contains  entries about Anne's burgeoning sexuality and  confrontations with her 
    mother that were cut from  previous editions. Anne Frank's The Diary of a  Young Girl is among the most enduring 
     documents of the twentieth century. Since its  publication in 1947, it has been a beloved and deeply  admired 
     monument to the indestructible nature of the  human spirit, read by millions of people and  translated into more
      than fifty-five languages.  Doubleday, which published the first English translation  of the diary in 1952, now 
      offers a new translation  that captures Anne's youthful spirit and restores  the original material omitted by 
      Anne's father,  Otto -- approximately thirty percent of the diary.  The elder Frank excised details about Anne's 
       emerging sexuality, and about the often-stormy relations  between Anne and her mother.
