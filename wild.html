   <p class="des"><b>Into the wild</b> <br> <br> In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do familyt hitcchiked to alaska and
    walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt.mckinley. His name was christopher Johnson mcCandless.He had given 25,000
    in savings to charity,abandoned his car and most of his possessions,burned all the ash in his wallet, and invented the 
    new life for himself.Four months later,his desd body was found by the moose hunter.How he came to die is the unforgettable
    story of into the wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, he had roamed through the west and south
    west on a vision quest like those made by his heroes jack london and john muir.In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and , unencumbered
     by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented.
