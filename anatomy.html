   <p class="des"><b>Anatomy:a love story <br> <br>Hazel Sinnett is a lady who wants to be a surgeon more than she wants to marry.

    Jack Currer is a resurrection man who’s just trying to survive in a city where it’s too easy to die.
    
    When the two of them have a chance encounter outside the Edinburgh Anatomist’s Society, Hazel thinks nothing of it at first. But after she gets kicked out of renowned surgeon
     Dr. Beecham’s lectures for being the wrong gender, she realizes that her new acquaintance might be more helpful than she first thought. Because Hazel has made a deal with Dr. Beecham: if she can pass the medical examination on her own, the university will allow her to enroll. Without official lessons, though, Hazel will need more than just her books – she’ll need bodies to study, corpses to dissect.
    
    Lucky that she’s made the acquaintance of someone who digs them up for a living, then.
    
    But Jack has his own problems: strange men have been seen skulking around cemeteries, his friends are disappearing off the streets. Hazel and Jack work together to uncover the secrets buried not just in unmarked graves, but in the very heart of Edinburgh society.</p>
